## Configure Mantle Owner
To mantle publish your place, he must to know what is the owner of the place,
if will be your personal account, or a roblox group. So we need setting it into `mantle.yml`.

If you are a solo game developer, is a external contribuitor, or is just testing,
you can just publish in your personal account
```yml
owner: personal
```
Or if this game is a serious project, that you have +1 developers,
or just want to organize game revenue and assets, publish into your group
```yml
owner:
    group: your_group_id
```

## Configure Github Environment
So you planning implement a CI/CD workflow, where you will automatically publish
your place when you push some change, you should configure a environment to be
used by github action
- Publish your repository to [Github](https://github.com)
- Go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`
- Create the variable:
    - `HUSKY = 0` to disable client git hooks on github server
- Create the secrets:
    - if you are publishing as a group `MANTLE_OPEN_CLOUD_API_KEY` for your
    Open Cloud API Key [Creating a Open Cloud API Key](#creating-a-open-cloud-api-key-link)
    - else if you just publishing as a person, `ROBLOSECURITY` for your personal
    roblox cookie [Getting your ROBLOXSECURITY cookie](#getting-your-robloxsecurity-cookie-link)
    - if you are using Amazon AWS or Cloudflare to store your `mantle-state.yml`,
    create `MANTLE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `MANTLE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## Configure Local Environment
If you looking for a local publishment, or you are a external contribuitor,
is recommended you just create a `.env` file in the root of the project,
and add the following variables:
```toml
MANTLE_OPEN_CLOUD_API_KEY="{api key}"

# If u want remote mantle state management
MANTLE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="{your access key id}"
MANTLE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="{your secret access key}"
```

## Configure Remote State Settings
For both the cases, you should update this part too
- if you want manage your mantle states remotelly (through Amazon AWS or Cloud Flare)
you must to fill those infos with your bucket infos
- otherwise you want manage them locally, just remote it
```yml
state:
  remote:
    region: # if is Amazon AWS, just the region
      custom: # if is Cloud Flare
        name: ENAM # Bucket Location
        endpoint: https://dc88f586de4d2c1eb08099d9e049613e.r2.cloudflarestorage.com # Bucket API S3
    bucket: starled-games-mantle-states # Bucket Name
    key: template # Prefix of .mantle-state.yml, tipically your project name
```
